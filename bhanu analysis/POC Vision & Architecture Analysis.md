POC Vision & Architecture Analysis

  Core Design Principles (from Meeting Transcript)

  1. Assistant-First Interface
  - Primary interaction is through chat/conversation
  - Slack-inspired navigation: Chat history + Dashboard tabs
  - Dashboards are created dynamically via chat commands, not pre-built
  - User asks "Show me X" ‚Üí Assistant creates a dashboard tab for that view

  2. Proactive AI Behavior
  - Assistant should anticipate needs and offer suggestions
  - Not just reactive - should identify patterns and recommend actions
  - Example: "I notice John Doe is overloaded. Should I rebalance his workload?"

  3. Light Mode Preference
  - Light mode preferred for demos and executive presentations
  - Better visibility and professional appearance
  - ‚úÖ Already implemented in our V3 project
