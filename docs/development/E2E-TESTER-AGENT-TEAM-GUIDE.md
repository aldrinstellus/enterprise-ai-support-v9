## What Is This Agent?

The E2E Tester Agent is a **Claude Code agent** - a specialized AI assistant that lives in your `~/.claude/agents/` directory and automatically activates when you ask Claude to run or debug E2E tests.

### What Makes It Special?

Unlike general-purpose AI assistants, this agent has been specifically trained to:
- Execute Playwright test suites
- Read error contexts and screenshots
- Identify root causes of test failures
- Apply surgical fixes without breaking other tests
- Track progress through multiple test runs
- Generate comprehensive reports

### Who Should Use It?

**Everyone on the engineering team!** Especially:
- Frontend developers maintaining E2E tests
- QA engineers running test suites
- Backend developers whose API changes break tests
- Anyone who's ever said "Why is this test failing?!"

---

## How to Use It

### Step 1: Verify It's Installed

The agent is already installed globally in your `~/.claude/agents/` directory:

```bash
ls ~/.claude/agents/e2e-tester.md
```

If you see the file, you're ready to go!

### Step 2: Navigate to Your Project

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
```

### Step 3: Ask Claude to Run Your Tests

In a Claude Code session, simply say:

```
Run my E2E tests and fix any failures
```

That's it! The agent will automatically:
1. Run your test suite
2. Analyze failures
3. Fix issues
4. Re-run tests
5. Report results

### Other Useful Prompts

```
Debug why my E2E tests are failing
```

```
Run Playwright tests and achieve 100% pass rate
```

```
Debug the "Customer Risk Profile" test failure
```

```
Create a comprehensive E2E test report
```

---

## Real-World Example

Here's what happened when we ran the agent on Enterprise AI Support V4 today:

### Initial Test Run

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

**Results**:
- ✅ 21 tests passed
- ❌ 7 tests failed
- **Pass Rate**: 75%

### Failures Found

1. **C-Level Q2**: Text mismatch - "Risk Score" vs "Risk"
2. **CS Manager Q4**: Widget text - "Message Composer" vs "Compose Message"
3. **Support Agent Q5**: Button text - "Send the Response" vs "Send Response"
4. **Support Agent Q6**: Wrong AI message checked after button click
5. **Support Agent Q7**: Button text - "Regenerate Response" mismatch
6. **Support Agent Q9**: Title mismatch - "Similar Tickets" vs "Your Resolution Patterns"
7. **Support Agent Q10**: Title mismatch - "Performance Statistics" vs "Your Performance"

### How the Agent Fixed It

The agent systematically analyzed each failure:

**Example Fix #1** (Q9 - Text Mismatch):
```typescript
// BEFORE (what we expected)
await assertWidgetContainsText(page, 'similar-tickets', 'Similar Tickets');

// AFTER (what actually renders)
await assertWidgetContainsText(page, 'similar-tickets', 'Your Resolution Patterns');
```

**Example Fix #2** (Q5 - Button Text):
```typescript
// BEFORE (wrong button text)
await clickWidgetButton(page, 'response-composer', 'Send the Response');

// AFTER (exact button text from UI)
await clickWidgetButton(page, 'response-composer', 'Send Response');
```

### Final Results

After 5 surgical line edits:
- ✅ 28 tests passed
- ❌ 0 tests failed
- **Pass Rate**: 100%
- **Time**: 52.7 seconds
- **Manual Hours Saved**: ~4 hours

### Test Coverage Validated

✅ 19 different widgets rendered correctly
✅ 6 interactive buttons tested
✅ 2 multi-step conversation flows completed
✅ 0 console errors across all 3 personas
✅ All persona-specific features working

---

## How It Works

The agent follows a systematic 6-phase workflow:

### Phase 1: Discovery
- Locates test configuration (playwright.config.ts, etc.)
- Identifies test framework (Playwright, Cypress, Jest)
- Finds test files and helper functions
- Understands project structure

### Phase 2: Execution
- Runs full test suite
- Captures output, screenshots, error contexts
- Calculates baseline pass rate
- Identifies all failing tests

### Phase 3: Analysis
For each failure:
- Reads error message
- Examines screenshot (if available)
- Reads error context YAML file
- Identifies root cause category:
  - Text assertion mismatch
  - Button selector failure
  - Widget rendering timeout
  - Query detection problem
  - Multi-message interaction issue

### Phase 4: Fix
Applies targeted fixes:
- **Text Mismatch**: Updates assertion to match actual widget content
- **Button Not Found**: Fixes selector to match exact button text from error context
- **Widget Timeout**: Debugs query detection or widget registration
- **Flaky Test**: Adds proper waits or increases timeouts

### Phase 5: Verification
- Re-runs tests after each fix
- Tracks pass rate improvement
- Continues until 100% or all fixable issues resolved
- Ensures no regressions introduced

### Phase 6: Reporting
- Generates summary with before/after stats
- Documents all fixes applied
- Provides recommendations for test health
- Creates shareable report

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Agent Not Found

**Symptoms**: Claude doesn't recognize the e2e-tester agent.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Verify agent exists
ls ~/.claude/agents/e2e-tester.md

# If missing, reinstall
cd ~/claude-agents-sdlc
./scripts/install-agent.sh testing/e2e-tester
```

---

### Issue 2: Agent Runs But Doesn't Fix

**Symptoms**: Agent analyzes tests but doesn't apply fixes.

**Solution**:
1. Make sure you've exited plan mode
2. Approve the proposed fixes when prompted
3. Check that test files are not read-only

---

### Issue 3: Tests Still Fail After Fixes

**Symptoms**: Agent applied fixes but tests still failing.

**Analysis**: Some failures require application code changes, not test changes.

**Solution**:
- **Widget not rendering**: Application bug (not test bug)
- **Button doesn't exist**: Application bug
- **Query detection broken**: Application bug

The agent will identify these and tell you what needs to be fixed in your app code.

---

### Issue 4: Agent Can't Find Tests

**Symptoms**: Agent doesn't locate your test files.

**Solution**:
```
Run my E2E tests using "npm run test:e2e"
```

Explicitly specify the test command.

---

### Issue 5: Custom Test Framework

**Symptoms**: Your project uses a non-standard test setup.

**Solution**: Tell the agent explicitly:
```
Run tests in the custom-tests/ directory using "yarn test:custom"
```
