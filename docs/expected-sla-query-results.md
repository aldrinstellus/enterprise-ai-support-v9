# Expected Results: SLA Query Comparison

## CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING

**Both queries show the SAME widget** - this is CORRECT and intentional!

The SLA Performance Chart widget shows the same data for both queries because they're both asking about SLA performance. The **ONLY** difference should be the **intro text** that appears above the widget.

---

## Query 1: "show me the sla performance breakdown"

### What You Type:
```
show me the sla performance breakdown
```

### Expected Response Text (Above Widget):
```
Here's the detailed SLA performance breakdown: [v2]
```

### Expected Widget Content:
**Widget Title:** SLA Performance Analysis

**Overall Stats:**
- Overall Compliance: 87%
- Target: 90%

**Categories Table:**
| Category | Target | Compliance | Status |
|----------|--------|------------|--------|
| First Response Time | < 1 hour | 94% | ✓ Success (green) |
| Critical Resolution | < 4 hours | 72% | ✗ Error (red) |
| High Priority Resolution | < 8 hours | 85% | ⚠️ Warning (yellow) |
| Medium Priority Resolution | < 24 hours | 91% | ✓ Success (green) |
| Low Priority Resolution | < 72 hours | 96% | ✓ Success (green) |

**Additional Info:**
- Breach counts for each category
- Average resolution times
- Trend indicators (stable/improving/declining)
- Trend chart with 4 weeks of historical data

---

## Query 2: "which categories are we failing"

### What You Type:
```
which categories are we failing
```

### Expected Response Text (Above Widget):
```
We're currently failing in these SLA categories: [v2]
```

### Expected Widget Content:
**EXACT SAME widget as Query 1:**
- Same title: "SLA Performance Analysis"
- Same overall compliance: 87%
- Same categories with same percentages
- Same Critical at 72% (red/failing)
- Same High Priority at 85% (yellow/warning)
- Same trend chart

## What "Working Correctly" Looks Like

### ✅ CORRECT (Fix is working):
- Query 1 shows: "Here's the detailed SLA performance breakdown: **[v2]**"
- Query 2 shows: "We're currently failing in these SLA categories: **[v2]**"
- Both show same widget (that's intentional!)
- You see **[v2]** marker in both responses

### ❌ INCORRECT (Still broken):
- Query 1 shows: "Here's the detailed SLA performance breakdown: **[v2]**"
- Query 2 shows: "Here's the detailed SLA performance breakdown: **[v2]**" ← Same text!
- Both show same widget
- At least you see [v2] marker (new code is running)

### ❌ INCORRECT (Browser cache):
- Query 1 shows: "Here's the detailed SLA performance breakdown" (NO [v2])
- Query 2 shows: "Here's the detailed SLA performance breakdown" (NO [v2])
- No [v2] marker means old cached code is still running

## Why This Happens

**Both queries intentionally show the same widget** because:
- They're both asking about SLA performance data
- The widget shows ALL categories (including failing ones)
- It answers both "show me breakdown" AND "which are failing"

**What makes them different:**
- The **intro text** provides context for how to read the widget
- Query 1: General overview tone
- Query 2: Focus-on-failures tone

**This is by design!** The widget is comprehensive enough to answer both questions.
