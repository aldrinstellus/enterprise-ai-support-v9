## Overview

Option 2 is a Claude Code-inspired interface that showcases how an AI assistant can execute tasks across multiple connected services (Zoho CRM, Zoho Desk, Slack, Google Calendar) and display beautifully formatted execution results.

**Key Focus**: This is a **demo/showcase interface** with mock data - no real API integrations.

## What This Is

A chat-based AI interface where users can:
- Ask the AI to perform cross-service tasks
- See step-by-step execution results
- View status indicators (✅ success, ❌ needs attention, ℹ️ info)
- Click example prompts to see demos
- Experience a Claude-like workflow for business automation
